# side_projects
collection of stuff I wanted to try just for fun ;-)

# twitter_tries
This subfolder contains a markdown file where I try out the twitter api and put the result in a nice {reactable}

# environment setup
This project uses {renv}, meaning after cloning you can run `renv::restore()` to get the packages required for this project installed.
